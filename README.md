### what is the point of software architecture.    

Designing software architecture is about "arranging components" of a system to best fit the desired "quality attributes" of the system.


gold of the building software :
solve complex problem in simple and effective way possible.   

Expected efficiency.

* The user cares that your system is fast, reliable and available.
* The Project manager cares that the system is delivered on time and on budget.   
* The CEO cares that the system contributes incremental values to his/her company.
* The head of security cares that the system is protected from malicious attacks.
* The application support team cares the the system is easy to understand and debug.


Quality Attributes

* Performance: how long do you have to wait before that spinning "loading" icon goes away.
* Availability: what percentage of the time is the system running
* Usability: if the developer what to add a feature to the system, is it easy to do.  
* Interoperability: does the system play nicely with other systems.
* Security: does the system have secure fortress around it.
* Protability: can the system run on many different platforms(eg: Windows vs. Mac vs Linux)
* Scalability: If you grow your user base rapidly, can the system easily scale to meet the new traffic.
* Deployability: is it easy to put a new feature in production.
* safety: if the software controls physical things, is it a hazard to the people.


Architecture makes   

1. Architecture enables quality attributes.
2. Architecture enables communication among stakeholders.
3. Architecture focuses on the assembly rather than creation of components.
4. Architecture restricts design choices, enabling creativity in other areas.
